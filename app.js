//will need const's connecting html to the JS (document.getelementID ('variable name'))

//will need arrays for actions, numbers, and both combined into another array 'buttons'

//will need a function that will cycle through (.forEach) each element in array 'buttons',
//----then will do an '.addEventListener' comparing if actions array includes each cycled element, then comparing if numbers
//----array includes the cycled element. and then pushing the element if in numbers (prevents actions occuring in succession)
//----bonus, figure out how to have it delete the last element if the last element is an 'action' (will make code non functional)

//both clear and equals will need their own event code for when user clicks

//test
